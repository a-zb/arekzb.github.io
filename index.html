            <h3><a href="http://php.net">Search on new PHP.net is not Firefox friendly</a></h3>
            <h6>Written by <a href="http://github.com/arekzb">arekzb</a> on July 22, 2013.</h6>

            <p>
                I like the new design of PHP.net website. It sometimes happens in a beta phase,- there's
                an issue that in my point of view is a show stopper.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have tried to use the new search widget on php.net and have found it to
                be a rather obtuse piece to work with. Not only does it enforce focus by taking the
                value of the element present under the mouse, but it will happily deny
                you using the backspace key to clear up the wrong suggestion. The mouse does not
                have to be moved at all. It simply needs to be above an element in the list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chrome doesn't suffer suffer from the same behaviour, but it is not a browser bug.
                Developers at php.net should take out the focus attribute, passed
                to catcomplete in common.js script file.
            </p>

            <p>
                <pre>
                $('#headsearch-keywords').catcomplete({
                ...
                focus: function(event, ui) {
                    $('#headsearch-keywords').val(ui.item.label);
                    return false;
                },
                ....
                });

                </pre>
            </p>

            <p>
                With the unnecessary focus callback out of the way, the auto-complete widget will no longer
                intrude on keystrokes and backspace key. This has been submitted as feedback as well.
                I hope that it gets addressed one way or another.

            <h3><a href="#">FUSE filesystem on OSX</a></h3>
            <h6>Written by <a href="http://github.com/arekzb">arekzb</a> on July 27, 2013.</h6>

            <p>
                I have been using MacFUSE on OSX for a long while, but newer versions of OSX
                don't work with it. The preferred library is OSX FUSE. It can be downloaded
                from here <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/osxfuse/?source=dlp">osxfuse</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Fuse is required by Dropfuse,- simple project of mine that allows for mounting
                shared folders created in DropBox. Once mounted, the shared folder
                appears in your file browser just as any other local folder.
            </p>

            <p>
                That's all. Thanks to a couple of users for bringing up the MacFUSE issue and
                as such, I could update the readme file with above instructions.

            <h3><a href="#">Closure::bind based reflection</a></h3>
            <h6>Written by <a href="http://github.com/arekzb">arekzb</a> on August 4, 2013.</h6>

            <p>
                Marco Pivotta wrote an interesting article about using Closure::bind method
                to access , read or write properties within objects. The interesting part about
                the concept is that it opens up the possiblity to get at private properties.
                
                See it closer here- 
                <a href="http://ocramius.github.io/blog/accessing-private-php-class-members-without-reflection/">
                Marco Pivotta,- Access to private members without reflection</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep in mind that this method isn't an encouraged way of poking around 
                object instances. It is neat and fast if your library is in a bind, pun
                intended.
